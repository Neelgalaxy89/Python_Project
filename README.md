# Python_Project
You have been given access to data from the data warehouse of an online aggregator for properties that tourists can rent out for short durations. The current sample is from all the listings in Antwerp Belgium.
The task is to generate an ML based solution that can be used to suggest appropriate listing prices to the property owner when they try to list a property out for rent.
